# Purpose
- I turned Vincent Dunn's (ret. Chief of NYC Fire Dept.) most recent book into electronic form, with interactive quizzes for each chapter and clickable images in the reading section.

# Method to Generate Book Text
- I made a java file to read a pdf version of Vincent's writing and populate the chapters.html file with an html version of the text with classes and styling included.

# Use
- The questions section is randomized, so that if you do a problem set for a given chapter twice you won't have short-term memory of which answer came after which.
- Skip button does what you would expect. You will come back to it at the end, and still need to finish all quesitons to submit the test.
- After you submit an answer (right or wrong), there is a "Go to Relevant Section" button that will take you to the approximate point in the text that you should have used to answer the question.
- You get feedback after the quiz is over about how well you scored, how much time you took, a summary of which questions you got wrong, and what the correct answers were.
